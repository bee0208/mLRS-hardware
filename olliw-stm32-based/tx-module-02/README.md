# ATTENTION #

The v042 designs for the base and the E22dual boards are up-to-date.

The v031 design for the E28dual board is legacy and will be replaced shortly by a new design following the v42 design, which are not fully hardware compatible to the designs here.

The v031 dualSx board will not be updated.
